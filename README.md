### üìÇ Mod Structure

Each mod must be in its own folder within the `Mods` directory. For example:

```plaintext
name="Name of the mod"
description="Description of the mod"
version="1.0"
author="Author of the mod"
mod="SampleMod.dll"
```

Additionally, the mod folder should include the mod's DLL file as specified in the manifest.
