## üõ†Ô∏è Mod Creation

Creating mods for Dungeon Clawler becomes more streamlined with this handler, especially when managing multiple mods. Although the handler currently doesn't simplify the mod creation process itself, future updates will include a custom API to facilitate creating game elements.

### üîß Sample Mod Project

A Sample Mod project is available in this GitHub repository called **DC-Sample Mod**. It's ready for compilation and use with the handler. This serves as a template to help you get started.

### üõ°Ô∏è Sample Item Mod Project

A Sample Item Mod project is available in this GitHub repository called **DC-SampleItem**. It's ready for compilation and use with the handler. This serves as a template to help you get started making items.

### üìÇ Mod Structure

Each mod must be in its own folder within the `Mods` directory. For example:

```
GameFolder/Mods/SampleMod
```

Each mod folder must contain a manifest file named `Manifest.txt` with the following format:

```plaintext
name="Name of the mod"
description="Description of the mod"
version="1.0"
author="Author of the mod"
mod="SampleMod.dll"
```

Additionally, the mod folder should include the mod's DLL file as specified in the manifest.

### üöÄ Loading Your Mod

Once your mod is set up:
1. Start the game.
2. Open the mods list from the "Mods" button.
3. Your mod should be listed and ready to use.
